### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup repo for #100days, updated standardhuman.github.io, started looking into D3, rendered a bar graph using CSS.

**Thoughts:**
It's really hard to figure out what to do. Spent a lot of time just figuring out how to get started. Nothing scarier than a blank page.

**Link(s) to work**
