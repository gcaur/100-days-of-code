### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup repo for #100days, updated standardhuman.github.io, started looking into D3, rendered a bar graph using CSS.

**Thoughts:**
It's really hard to figure out what to do. Spent a lot of time just figuring out how to get started. Nothing scarier than a blank page.

### Day 2: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ground on a factorial and palindrome algorithm.

**Thoughts:**
Algos are always good to get the gears grinding. Surprisingly difficult given that I've solved these both many times in the past. Feeling rusty.
