# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Projects:
  Positive Balance: react refactor, data viz, user authen
  Portfolio site:
  Journal app: Build using React methods

### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup repo for #100days, updated standardhuman.github.io, started looking into D3, rendered a bar graph using CSS.

**Thoughts:**
It's really hard to figure out what to do. Spent a lot of time just figuring out how to get started. Nothing scarier than a blank page.

### Day 2: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ground on a factorial and palindrome algorithm.

**Thoughts:**
Algos are always good to get the gears grinding. Surprisingly difficult given that I've solved these both many times in the past. Feeling rusty.

### Day 3: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactor of a pet react project

**Thoughts:**
Feeling increasing comfort with React. Managing state is still a trip but getting clearer. Locking down "this" context is next.

### Day 4: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued on FCC algos, specifically palindrome. Next step, overcome underscores and other non-alphanumeric characters.

**Thoughts:**
It's a rush to find a far more elegant way to a solution, even if not a complete solution.

### Day 5: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed my most robust palindrome checker yet, then quickly crushed a longest-element-in-array problem.

**Thoughts:**
Worth every second of effort. Of course, it only feels that way when it's over.

### Day 5: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a pluralizing function (from scratch) for our application Positive Balance

**Thoughts:** That was super fun.
